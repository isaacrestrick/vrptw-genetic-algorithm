## 🎯 What is VRPTW?

The **Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW)** is a complex combinatorial optimization problem that extends the classic Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) by adding time constraints. In VRPTW:

- **Multiple vehicles** must visit a set of customers
- Each **customer has a time window** during which they must be served
- **Vehicles have limited capacity** and must return to depot
- The goal is to **minimize total distance** while respecting all constraints

VRPTW is **NP-hard**, meaning optimal solutions are computationally expensive for large instances. Genetic algorithms provide excellent approximate solutions.

## ✨ Features

- 🎯 **Complete VRPTW Implementation**: Full problem modeling with time windows, capacities, and service times

## 🧬 Algorithm Overview

### Genetic Representation
- **Chromosome**: List of routes, one per vehicle
- **Gene**: Customer ID within a route
- **Fitness**: Total distance + penalties for constraint violations

### Genetic Operators

#### Selection
- **Tournament Selection**: Selects best individuals from random subsets
- Maintains population diversity while favoring fit solutions

#### Crossover
- **Order Crossover**: Preserves relative ordering of customers
- Handles variable-length routes appropriately

#### Mutation
- **Swap**: Exchange customers between routes
- **Move**: Relocate customer to different route
- **Reverse**: Reverse segments within routes

### Fitness Function
```
Fitness = Total_Distance + Penalty_Capacity + Penalty_Time_Windows + Penalty_Depot_Return
```

Penalties ensure constraint satisfaction while allowing infeasible solutions to guide search.

## 📊 Visualization

### Solution Visualization
- Interactive routes colored by vehicle
- Customer time windows displayed on hover
- Depot marked with star symbol
- Distance and feasibility indicators

### Fitness Evolution
- Best and average fitness over generations
- Convergence analysis
- Performance comparison across runs

## 📚 Examples

### Basic Usage
```python
from vrptw import Customer, Vehicle, VRPTWProblem, VRPTWGeneticAlgorithm

# Create problem
depot = Customer(id=0, x=0, y=0, demand=0, ready_time=0, due_time=480, service_time=0)
customers = [...]  # Your customers
vehicles = [...]   # Your vehicles

problem = VRPTWProblem(customers, vehicles, depot)

# Solve with genetic algorithm
ga = VRPTWGeneticAlgorithm(problem, population_size=100, generations=200)
best_solution, routes, fitness = ga.evolve()

# Visualize results
fig = ga.visualize_solution(routes)
fig.show()
```

### Parameter Tuning
```python
# Experiment with different parameters
ga_configs = [
    {'mutation_rate': 0.1, 'crossover_rate': 0.8},
    {'mutation_rate': 0.2, 'crossover_rate': 0.9},
    {'mutation_rate': 0.3, 'crossover_rate': 0.7}
]

for config in ga_configs:
    ga = VRPTWGeneticAlgorithm(problem, **config)
    # Compare performance...
```

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
cd tests
python -m unittest test_vrptw.py
```

Tests cover:
- Problem creation and validation
- Genetic operators (crossover, mutation)
- Fitness evaluation
- Edge cases (empty routes, single customer)
- Constraint handling

## 📈 Performance Tips

1. **Population Size**: 50-200 individuals (larger = better solutions, slower)
2. **Generations**: 100-500 (more generations = better convergence)
3. **Mutation Rate**: 0.1-0.3 (higher = more exploration)
4. **Crossover Rate**: 0.7-0.9 (higher = more exploitation)

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions welcome! Areas for improvement:

- Additional crossover operators
- Local search improvement heuristics
- Parallel processing for large populations
- More benchmark problem instances
- Alternative metaheuristics (ACO, SA, etc.)
